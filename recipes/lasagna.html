    <li><strong>Cheeses: </strong>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Meat:</strong> Remove the casings from the sweet Italian sausages, then crumble them along with the lean ground beef into a large skillet. Cook over medium heat until browned. Add finely chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet. Continue cooking until the onion is translucent and the garlic is fragrant.</li>

    <li><strong>Create the Sauce Base:</strong> Stir in a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste into the skillet with the cooked meat, onion, and garlic. Add two tablespoons of white sugar to balance the acidity of the tomatoes and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>

    <li><strong>Season the Sauce:</strong> Sprinkle in fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper to taste. Stir the sauce well to incorporate all the flavors. Allow the sauce to simmer on low heat for about 20-30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>

    <li><strong>Prepare the Cheese Mixture:</strong> In a separate bowl, combine ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, and one beaten egg. Mix well until the ingredients are evenly distributed.</li>

    <li><strong>Layering:</strong> In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Arrange lasagna noodles over the sauce, followed by a layer of the cheese mixture. Repeat this layering process until all ingredients are used, ensuring the top layer is meat sauce.</li>

    <li><strong>Baking:</strong> Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 45 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 15 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>

    <li><strong>Rest and Serve:</strong> Allow the lasagna to rest for about 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the layers to set, making it easier to cut into neat portions. Enjoy your delicious and hearty homemade lasagna!</li>
